<h1>What is HyperText</h1>Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.<p>
Hypertext is text which contains <a terms="#">links</a> to other texts. The term was coined by <a href="#">Ted Nelson</a> around 1965 (see <a href="x">History</a> ).
<p>
HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and <a href="#">sound</a> , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.<p>
Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.<p>
